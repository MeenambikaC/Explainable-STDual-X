# 🧠 STDual-X: Spatio-Temporal Dual Attention Transformer with Cross-Sensor Attention for Human Activity Recognition

## 📄 Abstract
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is essential in various fields, including healthcare, surveillance, and sports. HAR based on Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor data has recently gained attention due to its **non-intrusive** and **straightforward data acquisition** process compared to video-based or electromyogram (EMG)-based approaches.  

Human activities exhibit **complex spatiotemporal dynamics**, necessitating the extraction of discriminative spatiotemporal features from IMU data to develop effective HAR systems. While deep learning models have been extensively explored for HAR, existing approaches often struggle to capture these intricate patterns. Moreover, they often **overlook coordinated movements** across multiple body parts and fail to **utilize inter-sensor relationships** effectively.

This work introduces **STDual-X**, a novel HAR framework that employs **Spatio-Temporal Dual Attention Transformers (STDAT)** with **Cross-Sensor Attention (CSA)** to enhance activity recognition accuracy.  
- **STDAT** extracts rich spatiotemporal representations from IMU signals.  
- **CSA** leverages relationships among multiple sensors placed on different body parts to improve classification performance.  

Experiments conducted on benchmark public datasets — **PAMAP2**, **Opportunity**, and **UCI-HAR** — demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, achieving **state-of-the-art accuracies**:
- PAMAP2: **97.02%**
- Opportunity: **95.43%**
- UCI-HAR: **98.80%**
